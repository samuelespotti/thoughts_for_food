    <div class="introduction">
        <p><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">M</span>ore and</span> more people are eating vegan meals – and part of the reason is it’s seen as healthier. <span class="capital">I</span>s it really better for you? In the first of a new vegan series on BBC Future and BBC Good Food, Jessica Brown looks at the evidence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p> <span class="keyphrase">The number of people cutting down on <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat1">meat</span> and dairy, or cutting these foods from their diets entirely, has been rising over the last decade.</span> <span class="capital">T</span>he number of vegans in the UK, for example, quadrupled between 2006 and 2018, according to research by <span class="text_occurrence_TheVeganSociety" id ="The VeganSociety1">The Vegan Society</span>.</p>
        <p>One common motivation for shunning steak and stilton and going vegan is the promised health benefits. <span class="capital">T</span>he vegan diet is generally considered to be higher in fibre and lower in cholesterol, <span class="text_occurrence_protein">protein</span>, calcium and salt than an omnivorous diet – but there are still misconceptions and concerns around cutting <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat2">meat</span>, fish, eggs and dairy completely from our diets.</p>
        <p about="topic_concernB12"> <span class="keyphrase">One common concern is whether a vegan diet provides enough vitamin <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_1">B12</span>.</span> <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_2">B12 </span> helps prevent nerve damage, and is found in <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat3">meat</span>, fish, eggs and dairy, but not in <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit1">fruit</span> or vegetables. <span class="capital">I</span>t's recommended that adults consume 1.5 micrograms of the vitamin per day.</p>
        <p about="topic_concernB12">“A <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_3">B12</span> deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms such as numbness, and it’s irreversible if the deficiency is present for too long,” says <span class="text_occurrence_JanetCade" id="JanetCade1">Janet Cade </span>, of the <span class="text_occurrence_NutritionalEpidemiologyGroup" id="NutritionalEpidemiologyGroup1">Nutritional Epidemiology Group, School of Food Science and Nutrition</span>.</p>
        <p about="topic_healthbenefits">A recent study involving 48,000 people over 18 years compared the health of <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat4">meat-eaters</span>, pescatarians – who eat fish and dairy but not <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat5">meat</span> – and vegetarians, including some vegans. <span class="capital">T</span>hey found that people who eat vegan and vegetarian diets have a lower risk of heart disease, <span about="topic_healthrisks">but a higher risk of stroke, possibly partly due to a lack of <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_4">B12</span>.</span></p>
        <p about="topic_healthbenefits"> <span class="keyphrase">The researchers found that those who didn’t eat <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat6">meat</span> had 10 fewer cases of heart disease and  <span about="topic_healthrisks">three more strokes per 1,000 people compared with the <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat7">meat-eaters</span></span>.</span> <span class="capital">R</span>esearcher <span class="text_occurrence_TammyTong" id="TammmmyTong1">Tammy Tong</span>, nutritional epidemiologist at the <span class="text_occurrence_Oxford" id="Oxford1">University of Oxford</span>, says the higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke could be for several reasons.</p>
        <p>Haemorrhagic stroke is caused by a bleeding in the brain. <span class="capital">W</span>hile low cholesterol is protective for heart disease and ischemic stroke, there’s some evidence showing that low cholesterol levels (associated with the vegan and vegetarian diet) may be linked to a small risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</p>

        <p>“Vegans and vegetarians also have a higher risk of <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_5">B12</span> deficiency, which may be linked to higher risk of stroke,” she says.</p>
        <p>But it’s easy to get the “minuscule” amount of <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_6">B12</span> we need from nutritional yeast or fortified food, such as plant-based milks, says <span class="text_occurrence_MarcoSpringmann" id="MarcoSpringmann1">Marco Springmann</span>, senior researcher of environmental sustainability and public health at the <span class="text_occurrence_Oxford" id="Oxford2">University of Oxford</span>.</p>
        <p>In countries where food isn’t fortified with <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_7">B12</span>, he recommends vitamin supplements. <span class="capital">H</span>owever, the <span class="text_occurrence_AcademyofNutritionandDietetics" id="AcademyofNutritionandDietetics1">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</span> states that nutritional yeast isn’t an adequate source of <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_8">B12</span>, and vegans must take supplements or eat fortified food.</p>
        <p><span class="text_occurrence_JanetCade" id="JanetCade2">Cade</span> also recommends that vegans take <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_9">B12</span> supplements, and ensure any children and babies being fed a vegan diet get enough <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_10">B12</span>.</p>

            <p><i>It’s unlikely a vegan diet will cause an iron deficiency, says <span class="text_occurrence_MarcoSpringmann" id="MarcoSpringmann2">Springmann</span>, as long as your diet includes <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit2">fruit</span> and vegetables of every colour</i></p>
        </div> 
        <p about="topic_concernprotein"> <span class="keyphrase">Another common concern for those tempted to transition is whether a vegan diet provides enough <span class="text_occurrence_protein">protein</span>.</span> <span class="capital">B</span>ut while there isn’t much <span class="text_occurrence_protein">protein</span> in and vegetables, <span class="text_occurrence_MarcoSpringmann" id="MarcoSpringmann3">Springmann</span> says, this isn’t cause for concern.</p>
        <p about="topic_concernprotein">“We’ve never [seen] issues with <span class="text_occurrence_protein">protein</span> deficiencies, only in people who don’t eat enough calories, he says. “<span class="text_occurrence_protein">Protein</span> is in everything.”</p>
        <p about="topic_concernprotein">For those who are concerned, soy milk has roughly the same amount of <span class="text_occurrence_protein">protein</span> as cow’s milk.</p>
        <p>It’s also it’s unlikely a vegan diet will cause an iron deficiency, says <span class="text_occurrence_MarcoSpringmann" id="MarcoSpringmann4">Springmann</span>, as long as your diet includes <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit3">fruit</span> and vegetables of every colour.</p>
        <p>“Over time, the body can adapt to how much iron there is in our diet, and if you have a lower iron intake it can make more efficient use of that iron,” he says.</p>
        <p><span class="text_occurrence_MarcoSpringmann" id="MarcoSpringmann5">Springmann</span> says a balanced vegan diet is one of the healthiest diets.</p>

            <figcaption><i>The vegan diet is thought to be one of the healthiest because it includes plenty of legumes aswell as <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit4">fruit</span> and vegetables (Credit: Getty Images)</i></figcaption> 
        </figure>
        <p about="topic_healthbenefits" class="keyphrase">“We’ve found that the vegan diet could be one of the healthiest diets, outperforming pescatarian and vegetarian, because the vegan diet is higher in <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit5">fruit</span>, vegetables and legumes and the health benefits from this compensate anything else,” says <span class="text_occurrence_MarcoSpringmann" id="MarcoSpringmann6">Springmann</span>.</p>
        <p>He advises eating plenty of <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit6">fruit</span> and vegetables with a variety of colours, nuts, <span class="text_occurrence_grain" id="vegan_grain1">wholegrains</span> and beans and lentils, as well as chia, hemp and flax seeds, which contain <span class="text_occurrence_omega3" id="omega3_1">omega 3</span>.</p>
        <p>For those who worry that the vegan diet doesn’t offer enough variety, one study in 2018 found no evidence that a more varied diet promotes a healthier diet or weight. <span class="capital">I</span>n fact, they found that those who ate a more diverse diet tended to eat more processed foods and sugary drinks.</p>
        <p>Speaking of unhealthy foods, <span class="text_occurrence_MarcoSpringmann" id="MarcoSpringmann7">Springmann</span> is concerned about the rising popularity of vegan junk food. “These junk food vegan replacements can give you the same consumption profile as an unhealthy omnivore,” he says.</p>
        <div class="riquadro_extra">
            <p><i>People who ate more <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit7">fruit</span> and vegetables generally ate less red and processed <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat8">meat</span>, dairy and fish</i></p>
        </div>
        <p about="topic_healthbenefits">But this doesn’t have to be the case. <span class="capital">I</span>n a recent study looking at the effects of a diet high in plants, but not strictly vegan, researchers used indexes that ranked people according to how much of their diet consisted of plant-based foods, compared to animal foods. <span class="capital">E</span>ven those who ate the most plant-based foods also ate some dairy, fish and <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat9">meat</span>.</p>
        <p about="topic_healthbenefits">Those who had the most plant-based diets, and lower intakes of animal products, scored better on health markers. <span class="capital">T</span>here was up to a 32% lower risk among those with the highest intake of plant-based foods for cardiovascular disease, after adjusting for age, sex, race, education and health behaviours such as smoking, alcohol intake and exercise.</p>
        <p> <span class="keyphrase">“We found a striking relationship between adherence to dietary patterns and risk of important clinical outcomes,”</span> says study author <span class="text_occurrence_CaseyRebholz" id="CaseyRebholz1">Casey Rebholz</span>, an assistant professor at the <span class="text_occurrence_JhonHopkinsSchool" id="JhonHopkinsSchool1">John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's in Baltimore</span>.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>She found that people who ate more <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit8">fruit</span> and vegetables generally ate less red and processed <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat10">meat</span>, dairy and fish. <span class="capital">H</span>owever, the research doesn’t confirm if the relationship between eating more plant-based foods and a lower risk of heart disease drops off at a certain point. <span class="capital">I</span>n other words, it didn’t prove whether a strictly vegan diet is any more beneficial than a diet made up mostly of <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit9">fruit</span> and vegetables, but with some animal products.</p>
        <p>“It’s what a plant-based diet gives you, and the food it generally steers you way from, that’s beneficial,” says <span class="text_occurrence_CaseyRebholz" id="CaseyRebholz2">Casey</span>.</p>
        <p>“I believe that the health benefits from a plant-based diet are from a combination of eating more <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit10">fruit</span> and vegetables, and lower amounts of animal foods, including saturated <span class="text_occurrence_fat" id="vegan_fat1">fat</span>.” (Find out more about how saturated <span class="text_occurrence_fat" id="vegan_fat2">fat</span> affects your health).</p>

            <p><i>Typically, vegans smoke less, drink less alcohol and exercise more - <span class="text_occurrence_FaidonMagkos" id="FaidonMagkos1">Faidon Magkos</span></i></p>
        </div> 
        <p about="topic_difficultresearch" class="keyphrase"> Researchers are concerned that a lot of research comparing the vegan diet and health outcomes (also known as observational research) is unreliable, since vegans tend to be healthier.</p>
        <p>“Typically, vegans smoke less, drink less alcohol and exercise more,” says <span class="text_occurrence_FaidonMagkos" id="FaidonMagkos2">Faidon Magkos</span>, associate professor at the <span class="text_occurrence_UniversityofCopenhagen" id="UniversityofCopenhagen1">University of Copenhagen</span>'s department of nutrition, exercise and sports, who last year published a review into research examining the health effects of the vegan diet.</p>
        <p>These lifestyle factors, which can also contribute to a lower risk of heart disease and mortality, can suggest that the vegan diet alone is healthier than it may actually be. <span class="capital">T</span>hese studies serve as a starting point, says <span class="text_occurrence_FaidonMagkos" id="FaidonMagkos3">Faidon</span>, and because most data on veganism is observation, there are still uncertainties around the vegan diet, particularly when it comes to long-term effects.</p>
        <p>While higher blood glucose could indicate a higher risk of developing diabetes, for example, this isn’t necessarily the case.</p>

            <figcaption><i>Vegetarians don't get <span class="text_occurrence_protein">protein</span> deficiencies because many plant-based foods contain <span class="text_occurrence_protein">protein</span> (Credit: Getty Images)</i></figcaption> 
        </figure>
        <p>To see if a dietary change affects health, you’d have to follow participants for long enough to develop disease outcomes, with intervention studies that are at least a year long,” says <span class="text_occurrence_FaidonMagkos" id="FaidonMagkos4">Faidon</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="text_occurrence_EvelynMedawar" id="EvelynMedawar1">Evelyn Medawar</span>, author of a review of randomised controlled trials looking at the metabolic benefits of a plant-based diet, says it’s really important that more researchers start looking at the health effects of the diet.</p>
        <p><span class="keyphrase">“As the moment, society is ahead of research when it comes to the vegan diet,”</span> she says.</p>
        <p>Lots of people have doubts about the vegan diet due to potential nutrient deficiencies, and only now are researchers looking into this and the long-term benefits and risks.</p>
        <div class="riquadro_extra">
            <p><i>The vegan diet seems to be linked to better general health, apart from bone density and fractures</i></p>
        </div> 
        <p>“We need to take these fears away, or get to know the long-term consequences. <span class="capital">T</span>his could make more people interested in taking up the vegan diet for health reasons.”</p>
        <p>It will take a couple of years, <span class="text_occurrence_EvelynMedawar" id="EvelynMedawar2">Medawar</span> says, before research is done to understand the mechanisms behind how a vegan diet affects our health, as it will require controlled studies.</p>
        <p><span class="keyphrase">But despite the lack of data on the vegan diet specifically, researchers say existing evidence on diet and health generally points to a few trends.</span></p>
        <p>While the evidence isn’t very strong for the vegan diet specifically, <span class="text_occurrence_JanetCade" id="JanetCade3">Cade</span> says, the vegan diet seems to be linked to better general health, apart from bone density and fractures, which may be more common due to possible lower calcium intake, and the likelihood of <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_12">B12</span> deficiency. (Read more about whether we should drink dairy milk to strengthen bones).</p>
        <p>XVegans have a lower body mass index (BMI) which means better cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The vegan diet is much like any other. <span class="capital">I</span>t can help to lower your risk of disease, or increase it – depending on the foods you eat.</p>
        <p>“If you compare a plant-based diet with an unhealthy diet that includes <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat11">meat</span>, the plant-based diet is certainly better,” <span class="text_occurrence_FaidonMagkos" id="FaidonMagkos5">Faidon</span> says.</p>
        <p class="keyphrase">“But if you follow a relatively prudent omnivorous diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, which is high in <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit11">fruit</span>, vegetables, legumes and low in <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="vegan_meat12">meat</span>, there’s evidence to suggest this type of omnivorous diet is at least as healthy as a vegan diet,” he says.</p>
        <p> <span class="keyphrase">There’s a lot more digging to be done before we know for certain if veganism can be healthier than any other diet – especially when it comes to long-term health effects.</span> <span class="capital">I</span>n the meantime, experts advise that the best vegan diet is one that includes lots of <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="vegan_fruit12">fruit</span> and vegetables, and <span class="text_occurrence_B12" id="B12_13">B12</span> supplements, and less vegan junk food.</p>
