        <h2>What is a “Mediterranean diet?</h2>
        <p><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">W</span>hen you</span> think about Mediterranean food, your mind may go to pizza and <span class="text_occurrence_pasta" id="pasta1">pasta</span> from Italy, or lamb chops from Greece, but these dishes don’t fit into the healthy dietary plans advertised as “Mediterranean.” <span class="keyphrase">A true Mediterranean diet is based on the region’s traditional <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="mediterranean_fruit1">fruits</span>, vegetables, beans, nuts, <span class="text_occurrence_seafood" id="seafood1">seafood</span>, olive oil, and dairy—with perhaps a glass or two of red <span class="text_occurrence_wine" id="wine1">wine</span></span>. <span class="capital">T</span>hat’s how the inhabitants of Crete, Greece, and southern Italy ate circa 1960, when their rates of chronic disease were among the lowest in the world and their life expectancy among the highest, despite having only limited medical services.</p>
        <p>And the real Mediterranean diet is about more than just eating fresh, wholesome food. <span class="keyphrase"><span class="capital">D</span>aily <span class="text_occurrence_physicalactivity" id="physicalactivity1">physical activity</span> and sharing meals with others are vital elements.</span> <span class="capital">T</span>ogether, they can have a profound effect on your mood and mental health and help you foster a deep appreciation for the pleasures of eating healthy and delicious foods.</p>
        <p>Of course, making changes to your diet is rarely easy, especially if you’re trying to move away from the convenience of processed and takeout foods. <span class="capital">B</span>ut the Mediterranean diet can be an inexpensive as well as a satisfying and very healthy way to eat. <span class="capital">M</span>aking the switch from pepperoni and <span class="text_occurrence_pasta" id="pasta2">pasta</span> to fish and avocados may take some effort, but you could soon be on a path to a healthier and longer life.</p>

        <p><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">A</span> traditional</span> Mediterranean diet consisting of large quantities of fresh <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="mediterranean_fruit2">fruits</span> and vegetables, nuts, fish, and olive oil—coupled with <span class="text_occurrence_physicalactivity" id="physicalactivity2">physical activity</span>—can reduce your risk of serious mental and physical health problems by:</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">Preventing heart disease and strokes.</b> Following a Mediterranean diet limits your intake of refined breads, processed foods, and red <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="mediterranean_meat1">meat</span>, and encourages drinking red <span class="text_occurrence_wine" id="wine2">wine</span> instead of hard liquor—all factors that can help prevent heart disease and stroke.</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">Keeping you agile.</b> If you’re an older adult, the nutrients gained with a Mediterranean diet may reduce your risk of developing muscle weakness and other signs of frailty by about 70 percent.</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">Reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s</b>. <span class="capital">R</span>esearch suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cholesterol, blood sugar levels, and overall blood vessel health, which in turn may reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">Halving the risk of Parkinson’s disease.</b> The high levels of antioxidants in the Mediterranean diet can prevent cells from undergoing a damaging process called oxidative stress, thereby cutting the risk of Parkinson’s disease in half.</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">Increasing longevity.</b> By reducing your risk of developing heart disease or cancer with the Mediterranean diet, you’re reducing your risk of death at any age by 20%.</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">Protecting against type 2 diabetes.</b> A Mediterranean diet is rich in fiber which digests slowly, prevents huge swings in blood sugar, and can help you maintain a healthy weight.</p>

        <h2>How to make the change</h2>
        <p><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">I</span>f you’re</span> feeling daunted by the thought of changing your eating habits to a Mediterranean diet, here are some suggestions to get you started:</p>
        <p about="topic_whattoeat"><b class="keyphrase">Eat lots of vegetables.</b> Try a simple plate of sliced tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and crumbled feta cheese, or load your thin crust pizza with peppers and mushrooms instead of sausage and pepperoni. <span class="capital">S</span>alads, soups, and crudité platters are also great ways to load up on vegetables.</p>
        <p about="topic_whattoeat"><b class="keyphrase">Always eat breakfast.</b><span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="mediterranean_fruit3">Fruit</span>, whole <span class="text_occurrence_grain" id="mediterranean_grain2">grains</span>, and other fiber-rich foods are a great way to start your day, keeping you pleasantly full for hours.</p>
        <p about="topic_healthbenefits"><b class="keyphrase">Eat <span class="text_occurrence_seafood" id="seafood2">seafood</span> twice a week.</b> Fish such as tuna, salmon, herring, sablefish (black cod), and sardines rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and shellfish like mussels, oysters, and clams have similar benefits for brain and heart health.</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">Cook a vegetarian meal one night a week.</b> If it’s helpful, you can jump on the “<span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="mediterranean_meat3">Meatless</span> Mondays” trend of foregoing <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="mediterranean_meat4">meat</span> on the first day of the week. <span class="capital">O</span>r simply pick a day where you build meals around beans, whole <span class="text_occurrence_grain" id="mediterranean_grain3">grains</span>, and vegetables. <span class="capital">O</span>nce you get the hang of it, try two nights a week.</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">Enjoy dairy products in moderation.</b> The <span class="text_occurrence_USDA" id="USDA1">U.S. <span class="capital">D</span>epartment of Agriculture (USDA)</span> recommends limiting saturated <span class="text_occurrence_fat" id="mediterranean_fat1">fat</span> to no more than 10% of your daily calories (about 200 calories for most people). <span class="capital">T</span>hat still allows you to enjoy dairy products such as natural (unprocessed) cheese and Greek or plain yogurt.</p>
        <p><b class="keyphrase">For dessert, eat fresh <span class="text_occurrence_fruit" id="mediterranean_fruit4">fruit</span>.</b> Instead of ice cream, cake or other baked goods,<span about="topic_whattoeat"> opt for strawberries, fresh figs, grapes, or apples.</span></p>

            <ul>
                <li>The concentration of mercury and other pollutants increases in larger fish, so it’s best to avoid eating large fish like shark, swordfish, tilefish, and king mackerel.</li>

                <li>For women who are pregnant, nursing mothers, and children aged 12 and younger, choose fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury, such as shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, Pollock, or catfish. <span class="capital">B</span>ecause of its higher mercury content, eat no more than 6 ounces (one average meal) of albacore tuna per week.</li>
