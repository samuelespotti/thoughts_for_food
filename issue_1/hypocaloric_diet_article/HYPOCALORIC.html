        <p><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">A</span>t Verywell</span>, we believe there is no one-size-fits-all approach to a <span class ="text_occurrence_health" id="health1">"healthy</span> lifestyle. <span class="capital">S</span>uccessful eating plans need to be individualized and take the whole person into consideration. <span class="capital">P</span>rior to starting a new diet plan, consult with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian, especially if you have an underlying <span class ="text_occurrence_health" id="health2">health</span> condition.</p>
        <p><span class="keyphrase">A low-calorie diet is a structured eating plan that restricts daily caloric intake, commonly for <span class="text_occurrence_weightloss" id="weightloss1">weight loss</span></span>. <span class="capital">F</span>ollowing a low-calorie diet typically means consuming around 1,200 to 1,500 calories per day, which creates a <span class="text_occurrence_caloriedeficit" id="caloriedeficit1">calorie deficit</span> that can lead to <span class="text_occurrence_weightloss" id="weightloss2">weight loss</span>. <span class="capital">A</span> low-calorie diet can be effective, but it requires a lot of discipline to work and be safe. <span class="capital">I</span>deally, you should seek help from a registered dietitian or doctor to not overly restrict your calories or miss out on essential nutrients.</p>
        <p>Scientists have been studying low-calorie diets since as far back as the 1980s, investigating claims that these restrictive eating plans may slow the aging process. <span class="keyphrase"><span class="capital">B</span>ut for <span class="text_occurrence_weightloss" id="weightloss3">weight loss</span>, the science is simple: Take in fewer calories than you burn (via daily living and deliberate exercise), and you will lose weight.</span></p>
        <p>However, just because the science is simple does not mean actually following a low-calorie diet plan is easy. <span class="keyphrase"><span class="capital">I</span>t takes planning and effort to understand and recognize <span class="text_occurrence_hunger" id="hunger1">hunger</span> cues and make sure those 1,200 to 1,500 calories are enough to fuel the body and contain the right nutrients.</span></p>
        <p>That's why a low-calorie diet is not recommended for everyone, including pregnant or breastfeeding women (who need enough calories to sustain their growing babies as well as themselves) and athletes (who need the energy from sufficient calories to perform).</p>

        <h2>What Can You Eat?</h2>
        <p><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">W</span>hile there</span> isn't one official low-calorie diet, nutrition experts say that you'll want to choose <span class ="text_occurrence_health" id="health3">healthy</span>, whole foods that are naturally low in calories for a sustainable eating plan. <span class="capital">Y</span>ou have the freedom to consume your calories whenever it works for you, but you may find that it's easier to stick with a low-calorie plan when you spread your intake over the course of a day.</p>
        <p about="topic_countingcalories"><span class="keyphrase">Low-calorie diets require counting calories.</span> <span class="capital">T</span>o count calories, you'll need to know how much food you're eating at each meal. <span class="capital">P</span>roponents of low-calorie diets often recommend starting with a kitchen scale and measuring cups to measure out all your servings, at least until you feel comfortable estimating your portions visually. Remember that your beverages may contain calories, so you need to measure and count what you drink.</p>
        <p about="topic_countingcalories">You'll increase your chances of success if you keep track of all the foods you eat.<span class="keyphrase"> <span class="capital">K</span>eep your food diary in a notebook or with a calorie counter app</span> such as MyFitnessPal or one included with a fitness monitor such as Fitbit. <span class="capital">F</span>ood trackers keep a daily log of your calories and also grade your diet for nutritional value. <span class="capital">A</span> food diary allows you to realize any habits that could be interfering with <span class="text_occurrence_weightloss" id="weightloss4">weight loss</span>, such as using food for comfort or as a reward.</p>

            <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
            <p about="topic_preliminaryactions"><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">B</span>efore you</span> start a low-calorie diet, it's always a good idea to get a physical examination, especially if you have any <span class ="text_occurrence_health" id="health4">health</span> conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. <span class="capital">I</span>t is also important to acknowledge (and get help for) any history of disordered eating. <span class="capital">I</span>ssues can be explored and addressed with a registered dietitian or qualified therapist.</p>
            <p about="topic_preliminaryactions">It's also recommended that you measure your body composition and decide on your goals. <span class="capital">F</span>or example, you can record your <span class ="text_occurrence_bodymassindex" id="bodymassindex1">body mass</span> index (BMI) and waist circumference, two measures other than weight that can show your progress.</p>
            <p about="topic_preliminaryactions">Next, <span class="keyphrase">determine your daily calorie need.</span> <span class="capital">T</span>his step is going to be different for everyone and will even change for you over time. <span class="capital">O</span>ne approach determines how many calories you need each day to maintain your current weight, then reducing that number by 100 to 500 calories.</p>
            <p >It's OK to start slowly with just a small reduction in calories. <span class="capital">A</span>fter all, low-calorie diets should be approached as a lifestyle modification—not a quick fix. <span class="capital">I</span>f you're over-exuberant in the beginning, you might find the calorie restriction too difficult later on.</p>
