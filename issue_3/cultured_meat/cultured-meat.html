        <p class="keyphrase"><span class="decorated">W</span><span class="first_two">ith its</span> origins in the late 1990’s, <span class="text_occurrence_lab" id="level_lab1">lab</span>-grown or cultured meat, is produced by providing stem cells extracted from the muscle of an animal with a suitable <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth1">growth</span> medium and nutrients, enabling them to proliferate and then differentiate to form muscle tissue. <span class="capital">C</span>reating meat in this way could help to address some of the environmental and ethical issues associated with livestock farming, as well as offer health benefits to <span class="text_occurrence_consumer" id="level_consumer1">consumer</span>s.
        </p>
        <p>Pairing cellular <span class="text_occurrence_agriculture" id="level_agriculture1">agriculture</span> with genetic engineering could also enable the development of novel <span class="text_occurrence_food" id="level_food1">food</span>s, with non-native features, that may be <span class="text_occurrence_nutritional" id="level_nutritional1">nutritional</span>ly enhanced. <span class="capital">I</span>n a study recently published in Metabolic Engineering, researchers from Tufts <span class="text_occurrence_university" id="level_university1">university</span> engineered bovine cells to endogenously produce phytoene, lycopene and β-carotene, and found a reduction in lipid oxidation levels when this cultured meat was cooked.  
        </p>
        <p>Technology Networks had the pleasure of speaking to Andrew Stout, lead author of the study, to learn how these cells were created and explore the benefits of engineering in the abilities to produce additional nutrients. <span class="capital">A</span>ndrew also discussed some of the challenges that are so far limiting the wider commercialization of cultured meat and how this may change in the future.</p>

        <p><em><strong><span class="decorated">A</span><span class="first_two">nna MacDonald</span> (AM): Can you give us an overview of the process by which the cow cells were engineered to produce the carotenoids?</strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong>Andrew Stout (AS)</strong></em>: To do this, we inserted three genes into the cells which encode enzymes that convert native compounds into carotenoids. <span class="capital">S</span>pecifically, the first gene in this pathway (phytoene synthase) takes a native chemical and turns it into the carotenoid phytoene. <span class="capital">T</span>he second gene (phytoene desaturase) turns some of that phytoene into a second carotenoid called lycopene. <span class="capital">A</span>nd the third gene (lycopene cyclase) turns some of that lycopene into a third carotenoid called <span class="text_occurrence_beta-carotene" id="level_beta-carotene1">beta-carotene</span>. <span class="capital">I</span>n that way, we're able to get cow cells to produce three different carotenoids that aren't naturally produced in bovine tissue. <span class="capital">T</span>o engineer the cells, we used a system called the Sleeping beauty transposon system. <span class="keyphrase"><span class="capital">T</span>his system is essentially a "cut and paste" tool which randomly cuts open the cells' genomes and inserts new <span class="text_occurrence_DNA" id="level_DNA1">DNA</span> which we provide (in this case, the genes for carotenoid-producing enzymes).</span></p>

        <p><em><strong><span class="decorated">A</span><span class="first_two">M: Why</span> were <span class="text_occurrence_beta-carotene" id="level_beta-carotene2">beta-carotene</span>, phytoene and lycopene chosen in particular? </strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong>(AS)</strong></em>: There were several reasons for this. <span class="capital">T</span>he first and most important was their role as dietary antioxidants. <span class="capital">A</span> key mechanistic link between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer is through lipid oxidation. <span class="capital">T</span>his oxidation leads to the production of free radicals that can interact with tissue in the colon, damage cellular <span class="text_occurrence_DNA" id="level_DNA2">DNA</span>, and ultimately contribute to cancer formation. <span class="capital">A</span>ntioxidants can act to "quench" those free radicals, thus potentially inhibiting their cancer-causing potential. <span class="capital">A</span>s carotenoids are powerful antioxidants, they offer a promising target for improving the <span class="text_occurrence_nutritional" id="level_nutritional2">nutritional</span> features of cell-cultured meat.</p>
        <p>Other reasons include the importance of <span class="text_occurrence_beta-carotene" id="level_beta-carotene3">beta-carotene</span> as a vitamin A precursor, previous demonstrations of phytoene synthase efficacy in mammalian cells, and also as a sort of homage to golden rice, the first major demonstration of using genetic engineering to <span class="text_occurrence_nutritional" id="level_nutritional3">nutritional</span>ly enhance a <span class="text_occurrence_food" id="level_food2">food</span> product.</p>

        <p><em><strong><span class="decorated">A</span><span class="first_two">M: Were</span> there any side-effects as a result of the <span class="text_occurrence_nutritional" id="level_nutritional4">nutritional</span> engineering? </strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong>(AS)</strong></em>: There were a few. <span class="capital">T</span>he most obvious was a reduction in <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth2">growth</span> rate in bovine satellite cells that were engineered with carotenoid-producing enzymes. <span class="capital">T</span>his would have negative implications for production processes if it proves to be unavoidable. <span class="capital">I</span>nterestingly, though, in immortalized mouse muscle cells, this reduction in <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth3">growth</span> rate wasn't seen. <span class="capital">I</span>nstead, cells producing carotenoids actually grew faster than non-engineered cells. <span class="capital">O</span>ne explanation for this could be that immortalized cells are more "robust" and are more amenable to engineering than the primary (non-immortalized) cow muscle cells we used. <span class="capital">I</span>t's possible that immortalized cow cells would show <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth4">growth</span>-effects more like those seen in the mouse cells, which would turn this production down-side into a production up-side. <span class="capital">A</span>nother side effect we saw was a change in color of the cells -- they took on a reddish tinge with the production of the carotenoids. <span class="capital">I</span> don't think this is really a "positive" or "negative" effect, but it is pretty interesting. <span class="capital">O</span>ther potential side-effects that would need to be looked into would be the effects of carotenoids on cell differentiation, on the prevalence of other nutrients (e.g., cholesterol, etc.), and on flavor, texture, aroma, etc.</p>

        <p><em><strong><span class="decorated">K</span><span class="first_two">aren Steward </span>(KS): Why do you think you saw lower levels of lipid oxidation when the cell cultured meat was cooked compared to conventional meat?        </strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong>(AS)</strong></em>:Since carotenoids are antioxidants, they act to quench oxidation in cells during storage, cooking, etc., so we would expect lower lipid oxidation if the cells are producing carotenoids and therefore increasing the total cellular level of antioxidants.

        <p><em><strong>(AS)</strong></em>:<span class="keyphrase">This is a fun <span class="text_occurrence_question" id="level_question1">question</span>! I think we're an extremely long way from actually being able to use this technology to replace vegetables on our plates (and anyways, what a culinarily boring world that would be!)</span> I like to think of this technology not as a replacement of vegetables, but an enhancement of meat. <span class="capital">F</span>or instance, not all vegetables are high in carotenoids, so if you can get those nutrients from another source in your meal, then your overall consumption of them can increase. <span class="capital">A</span>lso, the roll of carotenoids in specifically inhibiting oxidation in meat can act to mitigate some of the negative health implications of meat consumption without aiming to reduce vegetable consumption. <span class="capital">A</span>s a final note, I'd like to think of this work as really just the tip of the iceberg of what's possible. <span class="capital">T</span>here are so many options for enhancing meat with this or similar technologies--enhanced flavor, therapeutic activity, enhanced smell, etc. <span class="keyphrase"><span class="capital">I</span> think there's a world of totally novel <span class="text_occurrence_food" id="level_food3">food</span>s that are possible and that would expand our culinary palette, not reduce it.</span>

        <p><em><strong>(AS)</strong></em>:No need at all! I think this would likely work for all mammalian cells, and there's a strong chance it would work for avian and fish cells as well. <span class="capital">W</span>e wanted to work with bovine cells because beef is such a major contributor to meat-associated greenhouse gas production and is one of the main red meats consumed around the world. <span class="capital">A</span>s such, I think it's a really important target for all cultured meat work, including <span class="text_occurrence_nutritional" id="level_nutritional5">nutritional</span> engineering.

        <p><em><strong>(AS)</strong></em>:The key hurdles are cost and scale. <span class="capital">T</span>he field needs to reduce the cost of <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth5">growth</span> media (likely by reducing the cost of <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth6">growth</span> factors, reducing cellular reliance on <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth7">growth</span> factors, finding <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth8">growth</span>-factor alternatives, or other creative solutions), and to increase the scalability of cell culture (increased <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth9">growth</span> rate, increased maximum cell density, etc.). <span class="capital">T</span>here are certainly plenty of other challenges, such as regulatory and <span class="text_occurrence_consumer" id="level_consumer2">consumer</span> reception, demonstration of <span class="text_occurrence_nutritional" id="level_nutritional6">nutritional</span> and <span class="text_occurrence_food" id="level_food4">food</span>-quality value, and demonstration of <span class="text_occurrence_food" id="level_food5">food</span>-safety, but I think that right now cost and scale still reign supreme.

        <p><em><strong><span class="decorated">A</span><span class="first_two">M: Where</span> do you see the future of cellular <span class="text_occurrence_agriculture" id="level_agriculture2">agriculture</span> headed?</strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong>(AS)</strong></em>:A good <span class="text_occurrence_question" id="level_question2">question</span>! I'll answer for two slightly different technologies.</p>

            <p>First, for cultured meat specifically:</p>
            
            <p about="near_future"><span class="keyphrase">I think in the near future, the field is heading towards a bit of a "realignment" or specification in terms of goals, expectations, hype, etc. <span class="capital">I</span> think that this can be seen in some of the ways that companies are starting to look at their products with a bit more nuance, such as looking at the possibility of hybrid cell-based/plant-based products, which could overcome some of the cost/scale barriers of a fully cell-cultured product.</span> <span class="capital">B</span>eyond that, I like to think that there will be an expansion of creative solutions to problems, or creative new ways of thinking about cell cultured meat. <span class="capital">T</span>his could come in the form of looking at agricultural waste products for cell culture components, exploring novel genetic strategies to improve <span class="text_occurrence_growth" id="level_growth10">growth</span> / reduce cost, or looking into alternate culture strategies / bioreactors.</p>
            
            <p>Then for cellular <span class="text_occurrence_agriculture" id="level_agriculture3">agriculture</span> more generally:</p>
            
            <p>I think cellular <span class="text_occurrence_agriculture" id="level_agriculture4">agriculture</span> in general, while certainly offering its own challenges and hurdles, is a lot further along the developmental pathway than cultured meat. <span class="capital">I</span>'m thinking here of products that are already on the market and demonstrably feasible such as recombinant milk proteins (Perfect Day <span class="text_occurrence_food" id="level_food6">food</span>s), recombinant collagen proteins (Geltor, Inc.), or recombinant proteins to improve plant-based products (Impossible <span class="text_occurrence_food" id="level_food7">food</span>s). <span class="keyphrase"><span class="capital">I</span> think these technologies are going to continue coming out and coming down in cost, allowing a bunch of new awesome products to come out and accelerate the development of plant-based or fermentation-derived products.</span>
