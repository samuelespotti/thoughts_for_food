        <h2>The Food Supply</h2>
        <p><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">C</span>astles could</span> store plenty of foodstuffs in the basement and ground floor of the tower keep as, without windows (to improve security during a siege), this part of the building was not much good for anything else. <span class="capital">I</span>n the courtyards of larger castles there were other buildings for brewing <span class="text_occurrence_beer">beer</span>, making bread, and more storage space such as the buttery which was used to keep a plentiful stock of <span class="text_occurrence_beer">beer</span>, <span class="text_occurrence_wine" id="medieval_wine1">wine</span> and cider (always useful if the water ran out during a prolonged attack). <span class="capital">T</span>here might also be a more select stock of spirits such as English mead or French brandy, kept in reserve for the lord and special occasions. <span class="capital">I</span>n larger castles there was, too, space for keeping livestock, perhaps a dovecote for pigeons, a granary for keeping grain and flour, a pond for <span class="text_occurrence_fish" id="medieval_fish1">fish</span> and a garden for growing herbs, fruit, vines and <span class="text_occurrence_vegetables" id="medieval_vegetables1">vegetables</span>.</p>
        <p> <span class="keyphrase">The foodstuffs came from the castle's own animals and lands or were paid to it as a form of tax by local farmers. <span about="topic_womenrole">It was the responsibility of the lady of the castle to oversee all the domestic aspects of castle-life including the food supply</span> (although a local sheriff actually procured the food required from peasants), the daily menu and the care of any guests.</span> Food supplies were not always regular, of course. <span class="capital">A</span>dverse weather conditions hit agriculture and disrupted availability, sending prices rocketing and making certain foods unobtainable. <span class="capital">F</span>ood production, as with most other human activities, was especially hit by such catastrophic events as war, famine and plague. <span class="capital">S</span>till, in the normal course of events, a daily dinner at the castle was an event not to be missed. </p>

        <h2>The Great Hall</h2>
        <p about="topic_wheredidtheyeat"><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">I</span>n the</span> Great Hall of the castle, which usually had an impressive high ceiling (perhaps even a vaulted one) and wall decorations of weapons, wall hangings, murals and coats of arms, there was a large fireplace for warmth and long tables with benches set around the walls for the diners. <span class="capital">E</span>ven the floor was taken care of and spread with straw and herbs to keep out pests and provide a little fragrance. <span class="capital">S</span>eating arrangements were quite well defined.<span class="keyphrase"> <span class="capital">T</span>he lord and lady of the castle with their immediate entourage usually sat on a raised platform at the end of the hall - the original high table and usually the most draught-free spot. <span class="capital">O</span>nly the lord of the castle and sometimes his lady sat on a chair; everyone else had to make do with the benches.</span> <span class="capital">T</span>he tables were simple affairs set on trestles which were only set up at mealtimes. <span class="capital">L</span>aid with a tablecloth, each place had a knife, spoon, and cup while shared between diners were jugs for drinking and a dish for salt.</p>
        <p>After normally having eaten a meagre breakfast of bread and <span class="text_occurrence_wine" id="medieval_wine2">wine</span>, and with only a simple supper in the later afternoon to look forward to, the diners would have been ready for their big <span class="text_occurrence_meal" id="medieval_meal2">meal</span> of the day, usually served between 10 am and 12 noon. <span class="capital">I</span>f it were a festival or a Christian holiday, then the <span class="text_occurrence_meal" id="medieval_meal3">meal</span>, ordinarily a pretty good one anyway, would be an extra special feast. <span class="capital">D</span>inner was announced by a chamberlain blowing a horn which was the signal for everyone to wash their hands in the bowl of water at their place. <span class="capital">A</span>s there were no forks and people cut up food with a knife and then used their fingers, retainers were always on hand with fresh bowls of water and towels. <span class="keyphrase"><span class="capital">C</span>uriously, dishes were served for two people and the less distinguished of the pairing was expected to cut the food and break the bread for the other. <span class="capital">O</span>ther conventions of decorum were not to put one's elbows on the table, not leave a spoon in the shared dish, not to take huge helpings, wipe the mouth before drinking, and never belch.</span></p>

        <h2>The Kitchen</h2>
        <p><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">C</span>hefs were</span> assisted, depending on the size of the castle, by such skilled specialists as a sauce chef, a slaughterer, a baker, a poulterer and a fruiterer. <span class="capital">O</span>ther staff included cupbearers, brewers, and people responsible for specific aspects of the medieval dining experience like the tablecloths, the candles, the silver dining service and getting the food to the guests from the kitchen before it got stone cold.</p>

        <p><span class="keyphrase">Chefs had a large open fire, spit braziers and an oven with which to whip up their magic.</span> <span class="capital">S</span>ome ovens were huge, as those commissioned by <span class="text_occurrence_kingjohn">King John of England</span> at both <span class="text_occurrence_castles">Marlborough and Ludgershall castles</span> where they were large enough to accommodate a whole oxen. <span class="capital">B</span>y the kitchen was a pantry where such goodies as cheese, eggs and bread were stored.</p>

        <h2>The Medieval Feast</h2>
        <p about="topic_socialdifferences"><span class="keyphrase"><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">T</span>he one</span> thing that differentiated the medieval rich from the poor more than any other in terms of food was <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat1">meat</span>.</span> <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat2">meat</span> could be fresh, salted or smoked, and included chicken, bacon, pork, beef, mutton, duck, geese, pigeons, and wild birds such as pheasants and partridges. <span class="capital">F</span>or the more adventurous diner there were cranes, larks and herons but just about anything with wings on it could find its way onto a castle dinner table. <span class="capital">T</span>hen there was four-legged game such as deer, hares and boars which were all captured on a hunt, an especially popular pastime for those rich enough not to have to work for a living. <span class="capital">M</span>ore exotic fare included swans and peacocks, which made especially impressive presentation dishes.</p>
        <div class="riquadro_extra">
            <p>THE MOST EXOTIC & EXPENSIVE SEAFOOD WAS STURGEON & WHALE, BOTH KNOWN AS THE “ROYAL <span class="text_occurrence_fish" id="medieval_fish2">fish</span>”. </p>
        </div>
        <p>The fashion in the Middle Ages was to boil <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat3">meat</span> in large cauldrons, a process known as 'seething'. <span class="capital">A</span>lternatively, it was roasted or grilled while <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat4">meat</span> stews and soups were prepared, too. <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat5">meat</span> dumplings were made from minced <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat6">meat</span> mixed with egg and breadcrumbs and then poached. <span class="capital">T</span>here was also a dish where <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat7">meat</span> was pounded into a paste and mixed with boiled rice. <span class="capital">F</span>inally, <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat8">meat</span> pies, pastries and fritters were prepared, and there were <span class="text_occurrence_fish" id="medieval_fish3">fish</span> pies, too. <span class="capital">C</span>ommonly eaten <span class="text_occurrence_fish" id="medieval_fish4">fish</span> included herring, cod, trout, sole, plaice, salmon, bream, pike, mackerel and mullet. <span class="text_occurrence_fish" id="medieval_fish5">fish</span> was fresh or had been smoked or salted to preserve it. <span class="capital">I</span>t was usually fried or cooked in a mix of ale and saltwater. <span class="keyphrase"><span class="capital">T</span>he most exotic and expensive examples of seafood were sturgeon and whale, both known as the “royal <span class="text_occurrence_fish" id="medieval_fish6">fish</span>” but there were also crayfish, eels, oysters and porpoise if the host wanted to impress his guests.</span></p>
        <p>The most common <span class="text_occurrence_vegetables" id="medieval_vegetables2">vegetables</span> were peas and beans but there were also root <span class="text_occurrence_vegetables" id="medieval_vegetables3">vegetables</span> such as carrots, parsnips, and burdock as well as lettuce, beets, cabbage, spinach, leeks, pumpkins and watercress. <span class="capital">C</span>apers and nuts were favourites. <span class="capital">B</span>read, darker than we are used to today because of the lack of refined flour, besides being a handy filler, was also used as a plate. <span class="capital">R</span>oast <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat9">meat</span>, in particular, was often served on a thick slice of one-day-old bread (a trencher or manchet) while other dishes came in bowls.</p>

        <p><span class="keyphrase">Dessert consisted of cheese, wafers and pastries such as fruit or cheese tarts. <span class="capital">F</span>ruits included apples, pears, plums, peaches, cherries and wild fruits.</span> <span class="capital">F</span>or the wealthiest of castle hosts, the exotic foodstuffs to be found on his table, which were brought in from abroad, included rice, almonds, raisins, oranges, pomegranates, figs and dates.</p>
        <p>Food could be seasoned using salt, vinegar, mustard, aniseed, and herbs (e.g. basil, fennel, rosemary, parsley, sage and mint). <span class="capital">H</span>oney was a common sweetener as was special sugar, sometimes made with roses and violets. <span class="capital">S</span>auces were prepared by grinding herbs and mixing them with <span class="text_occurrence_wine" id="medieval_wine4">wine</span>, the juice of unripe grapes (verjuice), or vinegar. <span class="capital">O</span>nions, garlic, ginger, saffron, cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon were also in the chef's repertoire to make the mundane more interesting and mask the taste of any <span class="text_occurrence_meat" id="medieval_meat10">meat</span> that had not fared so well in the castle's larder.  Spices were expensive, though, with 30 grammes of pepper, for example, costing the day's wages of a labourer.</p>
        <p><span class="keyphrase">For drinks, there was <span class="text_occurrence_wine" id="medieval_wine5">wine</span>, always drunk young as nobody had yet invented a good way to seal and store it indefinitely.</span> <span class="capital">D</span>ecanted from barrels into jugs it might have a few little additives like spices or sweeteners which was just as well because it was usually not very good according to several medieval commentators. <span class="capital">A</span>lternatively, but not really for the distinguished guest, there were <span class="text_occurrence_beer">beers</span> and ales made from barley, malt, wheat or oats. <span class="capital">B</span>eing weak in alcohol content it was also drunk by children. <span class="capital">W</span>ater was none too clean and best avoided.</p>

        <p about="topic_appetiteculture">All of this food could be spread over many courses, sometimes up to ten in a single <span class="text_occurrence_meal" id="medieval_meal5">meal</span>. <span class="capital">T</span>he diners need have no fear of seeming a bit greedy, though, as a good appetite was considered a great virtue in the medieval world. <span class="capital">I</span>ndeed, there were even such sayings as 'a man who eats heartily will never prove to be a coward' and knights, especially, probably tried to outdo each other on just how much food and drink they could put away. <span class="capital">O</span>ne of the most famous of all knights, the Englishman<span class="text_occurrence_sirmarshal"> Sir William Marshal</span> (c. 1146-1219 CE) was known as 'the glutton' or gaste-viande in his youth, and it was a term of endearment rather than criticism. <span class="capital">S</span>imilarly, another knight, <span class="text_occurrence_guydebourgogne">Guy de Bourgogne</span>, seems to have gone out of his way to impress his Saracen captors who reported that he had the appetite of four men.</p>

        <h2>Entertainment</h2>
        <p> <span class="keyphrase"><span class="first_two"><span class="decorated">W</span>hile the</span> guests were tucking into all this hearty fare, jugglers and jesters performed, perhaps a harpist offered some unobtrusive background music and minstrels sang and played the lute or <span class="text_occurrence_vielle">vielle</span> (an early version of the violin) for their entertainment.</span> <span class="capital">A</span>fter the <span class="text_occurrence_meal" id="medieval_meal6">meal</span>, guests who still felt up to it could play games such as dice, backgammon or the hugely popular chess, all of which might involve a bit of betting. <span class="capital">A</span>lternatively, the minstrels belted out a few songs, the <span class="text_occurrence_chanson">chanson de gestes and chansons d'amour</span>, actually epic poems in Old French which told familiar stories of knightly daring deeds and impossible romances respectively. <span class="capital">O</span>ne or two of the guests might perform songs they had themselves composed, such was the expectation upon a chivalrous knight and a suitable recompense for the host's generosity in offering such a fine dining experience.</p>
